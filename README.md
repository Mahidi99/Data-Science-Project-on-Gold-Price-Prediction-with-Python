Gold has always held a prominent place in the country’s economy and among the people. In this project, this introduce to a machine learning tutorial on Gold Price Prediction with Python.
Gold prices have historically skyrocketed, peaking at $ 1,800 in 2020. These swings that gold has faced can be attributed to several events that occurred during the period. Stock prices are strongly correlated with public information and world events, and gold is no exception.

Unlike other financial assets, precious metals behave positively in times of crisis. Indeed, in the face of events such as epidemics, wars and economic disruption, most assets experience a decline in their value. However, in search of cover, investors are turning their attention to gold. As a result, the demand for yellow metal increases, resulting in a rise in the market valuation.

Gold tends to be viewed as a strategic and tactical investment asset when considering portfolio diversification. 
However, the economic and financial aspects are not the only factors that can affect gold prices. Geopolitical factors may also influence the valuation of the yellow metal’s market.
